            My life is oriented around the practice of presence. I live the practice I offer to you; it's an active daily cultivation
            I've centered for many years of my life. I am a long time meditator in the zen tradition and practitioner of yoga, pilates, and somatic experiencing. I am a certified
            Anusara alignment-based yoga instructor. I've deeply explored and participated in Reichian, Jungian, and Hakomi therapy.

I am commited to clarity, trust, and kindness while staying in relationship with the negative feelings that arise. I have a rich life experience 
            working in kitchens, bars, as a scientist, a musician, a traveler, and a dancer.
            I have a master's in biochemistry and I worked for nearly 10 years as one of the first employees of a successful biotech company.
            I've learned how to work with diverse groups of people to get
            difficult stuff done in stressful environments. I've grown expertise in maintaining focus along with communication strategies to help everyone
            I'm working with act in alignment. 

I've woven and studied presence throughout my work and personal life. My work has brought me to leading an early technical team at a biotech company where I
led a key role through multiple cycles of growth, changing focus, and direction. I learned the skills to help everyone around me
maintain focus and manage the discomfort of uncertainty while staying active, conscious, and collaborative in their decision making.

What voices do we listen to ?

My life priority is to trust and listen to myself as deeply and clearly as I can in this moment. In my relationships, spiritual life, and creative work I rigorously
examine the voices that guide me and discern what is appropriate to listen and act on.
