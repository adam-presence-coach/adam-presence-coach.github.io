        <h2 class="section-heading">Why presence</h2>
            <!--
            Slow down. Listen to yourself. Shoulds. Expectations. Listen to our inner guidance. Inner perspective.
            We don't know we're missing it and we dont know how to get there. Description of what someone might be struggling with.

            Feeling alone. Emotions getting the better of you.

            Someone's going to be nervous to call to do this in the first place. How can I make what I'm saying safe and understandable.

            Why did I How did I come up with this idea in the first place. My story - I would meet people out in the world and it felt like they needed to
            wanted to be told that they could trust themselves that they could do what was right for them that they could have wants, and needs, desires,
            and feelings and they could listen to and trust those senses and act on them. I want to inspire people and support people in that action.

            some about where I'm coming from my expertise.

            how to schedule an appointment more specifically. How will we meet?

            I offer structured support of your life as a presence coach. 
            We will explore the feeling of presence together and codevelop strategies
            for bringing more presence into your life. No matter where you are on your journey
            we'll find ways to deepen your understanding of presence through concrete actions
            that you can begin practicing in this moment.
            -->
        <p>
            I invite you to close your eyes for a moment and take a slow deep breath in and out. What did you notice? Did any feelings, sensations, or thoughts pass by?
            Does stress or worry feel like the loudest voice inside of you? Are you feeling pulled in one thousand directions?
            Do you feel like you're not living your own life and that someone else is making all your decisions?
            Do you feel a sense of emptiness or an absence of meaning?

            Working with me is an invitation to slow down, to listen to yourself, and to free yourself of shoulds and expectations. We'll focus on cultivating your

            you can begin living your life with conviction and energy.
