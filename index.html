    <h2 class="section-heading">Why presence</h2>

    <p>I invite you to close your eyes for a moment and take a slow deep breath in and out.</p>

    <p>Slow inhale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow exhale.</p>

    <p>
        What did you notice? Did any feelings, sensations, or thoughts pass by?
        Does stress or worry feel like the loudest voice inside of you? Are you feeling pulled in one thousand directions?
        Do you feel like you're not living your own life and that someone else is making all your decisions?
        Do you feel a sense of emptiness or an absence of meaning?
    </p>

    <p>
        Working with me is an invitation to slow down, to listen to yourself, and to free yourself from shoulds and expectations.
        We'll focus on cultivating your inner perspective so you can trust yourself and the choices you make.
        We'll explore listening to yourself with gentleness and kindness so that you can begin living your life with conviction and energy.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">My skills and expertise</h2>

    <p>
        My life is oriented around the practice of presence. I live the practice I offer to you; it's an active daily cultivation I've centered in my life.
        I am a longtime meditator in the Zen tradition and a practitioner of yoga, pilates, and somatic experiencing. I am a certified
        Anusara alignment-based yoga instructor. I've deeply explored and participated in Reichian, Jungian, and Hakomi therapy.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've woven and studied presence throughout my work and personal life. My work has brought me to leading an early technical team at a biotech company,
        where I played a key role through multiple cycles of growth, changing focus, and direction. I learned the skills to help everyone around me maintain focus
        and manage the discomfort of uncertainty while staying active, conscious, and collaborative in their decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
        My life priority is to trust and listen to myself as deeply and clearly as I can in this moment. In my relationships, spiritual life, and creative work
        I rigorously examine the voices that guide me and discern what is appropriate to listen to and act on.
    </p>

    <p>
        I bring everything I've learned to our work together in order to help you grow and live the life you want with more 
        presence, intention, and clarity.
    </p>

        through concrete actions that you can begin practicing in this moment.
    </p>

        <li>You will look at ways to improve focus and attention.</li>
